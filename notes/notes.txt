The purpose of maintaining a session in this code is to organize and isolate user or process activities. Each session gets a unique directory (using a timestamp and UUID), so:

Files from different users or runs don’t overwrite each other.
You can track, audit, or debug actions for a specific session.
It’s easier to clean up or archive data related to a particular session.
Session-based organization supports multi-user or multi-process workflows.
This approach improves data management, traceability, and reliability in document handling.
